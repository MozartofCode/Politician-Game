# Politician-Game

This is a small web-based game where you guess which part a congress member belongs to.

It uses python (flask) as a backend while making an API call to the api.congress.gov to get information about congress members. 
And it uses React JS as a frontend to create tinder-like game logic of swiping right or left (democrat or republican buttons) and gives a feedback as a response to user's choice.
